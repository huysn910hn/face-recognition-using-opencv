The result notification part on the interface during the recognition process is not running in real time yet.

The interface uses tkinter and includes 4 main functions:
1. Enter the name of the person to be identified
2. Perform facial recognition sampling and display the interface sample and the number of samples taken
3. Real-time face verification via camera and display verification interface
4. Displays notification text for completed sampling operations and indicates whether the face is correct
